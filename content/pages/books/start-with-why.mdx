### Start With Why

Simon Sinek

#### Part 1 - A World That Doesn't Start With Why

- Pg 13 - "Sometimes whe things go right, we think we know why, but do we really?"
- Pg 17 - "When companies or organizations do not have a clear sense of why their customers are their customers, they tend to rely on a disproportionate number of manipulations to get what they need. And for good reason. Manipulations work."
  - It's really interesting to consider the idea of how manipulations work from the perspective of missionary work, or door-to-door sales.
  - Types of manipulations:
    - Price
    - Promotions
    - Fear
    - Aspirations -> Things we want or the person we wish we were
    - Peer Pressure
    - Novelty (aka Innovation)
  - The idea is that manipulations may be valuable in the short term, but they do not lead to loyal customers or employees in the long term.
- Pg 31 - "Manipulations are a perfectly valid strategy for driving a transaction, or for any behavior that is only required once or on rare occasions."

#### Part 2 - An Alternative Perspective

- Pg 37 - The Golden Circle is a set of concentric circles with "why" in the center, then "how" and then "what"
  - Why = Purpose = Drive = Doctrine
  - How = Values = Principles
  - What = Processes = Applications
- Pg 39 - A lot of companies miss out or fail because they focus on "WHAT" they do rather than "WHY" they do it.
  - Bad Example: "We make great computers... They're beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly."
  - Good Example: "Every thing we do, we believe in challenging the status quo. We believe in thinking differently. The way we challenge the status quo is by making our products beautifully designed, simple to use and user-friendly. And we happen to make great computers."
- Pg 49 - "A simple claim of better, even with the rational evidence to back it up can create desire and even motivate a decision to by, but it doesn't create loyalty."
- Pg 55 - "We are drawn to leaders and organizations [and products] that are good at communicating what they believe. Their ability to make us feel like we belong, to make us feel special, safe and not alone is part of what gives them the ability to inspire us."
  - Examples of brands: Apple, Nike, Pluralsight
  - Examples of leaders: Elder Holland, President Nelson, Nelson Mandela, MLK, Gandhi
- Pg 57 - "When you force people to make decisions with only the rational part of their brain, they almost invariably end up 'overthinking'"
- Pg 67 - "For values or guiding principles to be truly effective they have to be verbs"
    - "Integrity" vs "always do the right thing"
    - "Innovation" vs "look at the problem from a different angle"
- Pg 69 - "After you have clarity of WHY, and are disciplined and accountable to your own values and guiding principles [HOW], and are consistent in all you say or do [WHAT], the final step is to keep it all in the right order."
- Pg 80 - "The goal of business should not be to do business with anyone who simply wants what you have. It should be to focus on the people who believe what you believe. When we are selective about doing business only with those who believe in our WHY, trust emerges."
  - What if you have a good or product that you truly believe is for everyone?

#### Part 3 - Leaders Need a Following

- Pg 83 - A company's first responsibility is to its employees. Happy Employees -> Happy Customers -> Happy Shareholders
- Pg 84 - "Trust begins to emerge when we have a sense that another person or organization is driven by things other than their own self-gain."
- Pg 122 - Why I don't like Instagram influencers...

#### Part 4 - How to Rally Those Who Believe

- Pg 134 - "Charisma has nothing to do with energy; it comes from a clarity of WHY"
  - I'm not sure that I buy into this statement...
- Pg 156 - "As a company grows, the CEO's job is to personify the WHY. To ooze iof it. To talk about it. To preach it. To be a symbol of what the company believes."

#### Part 5 - The Biggest Challenge Is Success

- Pg 201 - "Great second or third CEO's don't take the helm to implement their own vision of the future; they pick up the original banner and lead the company into the next generation"

#### Part 6 - Discover Why
