A collection of quotes, insights and half-formed thoughts gathered while reading.

### Man's Search for Meaning

Viktor E Frankl

#### Foreword - Harold S Kushner

- Pg X - Frankl's most enduring insight:
    - "Forces beyond your control can take away everything you possess except one thing, your freedom to chose how you will respond to the situation. You cannot control what happens to you in life, but you can always control what you will feel and do about what happens to you."

#### Preface to the 1992 Edition

- Pg XIV - "Don't aim at success - the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's dedication to a cause greater than oneself or as a byproduct of on's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness mus happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it."

#### Part I - Experiences in a Concentration Camp

- Pg 8 - There are 3 periods of mental reactions to concentration camps:
    - Shock
    - Relative apathy (emotional death)
    - Depersonalization upon release (a dreamlike experience where one is unsure of reality)
- Pg 37 - "Love is the ultimate and the highest goal to which man can aspire... the salvation of man is through love and in love. I understood how a man who has nothing left in this world may still know bliss..."
- Pg 44 - "Suffering completely fills the human soul and conscious mind, no matter whether the suffering is great or little. Therefore the 'size' of human suffering is absolutely relative"
- Pg 62 - "The consciousness of one's inner value is anchored in higher, more spiritual things, and cannot be shaken by camp life. But how many free men, let alone prisoners, possess it?"
- Pg 65 - "The experiences of camp life show that man does have a choice of action."
- Pg 66 - "Everything can be taken from a man but one thing: the last of the human freedoms - to choose one's own attitude in any given set of circumstances, to choose one's own way."
- Pg 67 - Three ways to find purpose in life
    - "Active life serves the purpose of giving man the opportunity to realize values in creative work"
    - "Passive life of enjoyment affords him the opportunity to obtain fulfillment in experiencing beauty, art, or nature."
    - "Life which is almost barren of both creation and enjoyment and which admits of but one possibility of high moral behavior: namely, in man's attitude to his existence, an existence restricted by external forces."
- Pg 67 - "If there is a meaning in life at all, then there must be meaning in suffering. Suffering is an ineradicable part of life, even as fate and death. Without suffering and death human life cannot be complete."
- Pg 77 - "We had to learn ourselves and... that it did not really matter what we expected from life, but rather what life expected from us. We needed to stop asking ourselves about the meaning of life, and instead to think of ourselves as those who were being questioned by life - daily and hourly. Our answer must consist, not in talk and meditation, but in right action and in right conduct. Life ultimately means taking the responsibility to find the right answer to its problems and to fulfill the tasks which it constantly sets for each individual."
- Pg 82 - "'What you have experience, no power on earth can take from you.' Not only our experiences, but all we have done, whatever great thoughts we may have had, and all we have suffered, all this is not lost, though it is past; we have brought it into being. Having been is also a kind of being, and perhaps the surest kind."
- Pg 86 - "There are two races of men in this world, but ony these two - the 'race' of the decent man and the 'race' of the indecent man. Both are found everywhere; they penetrate into all groups of society. No group consist of entirely decent or indecent people."

#### Part II - Logotherapy in a Nutshell

- Pg 98 - Logos === "meaning" in Greek
- Pg 99 - The difference of logotherapy when compared to other schools of psychology
    - Will to _meaning_ - Logotherapy
    - Will to _pleasure_ - Freudian psychology
    - Will to _power_ = Alderian psychology
- Pg 104 - "Mental health is based on a certain degree of tension, the tension between what one has already achieved and what one still ought to accomplish, or the gap between what one is and what one should become."
- Pg 105 - "What man actually needs is not a tensionless state but rather the striving and struggling for a worthwhile goal."
- Pg 105 - "If architects want to strengthen a decrepit arch, the increase the load which is laid upon it."
- Pg 106 - There is a widespread phenomenon in society today known as the "existential vacuum." It manifests itself through feeling of meaninglessness and boredom.
- Pg 109 - "Man is questioned by life; and he can only answer to life by answering for his won life; to life he can only respond by being responsible. Thus, logotherapy see sin responsibleness the very essence of human existence."
- Pg 109 - One of Dr. Frankl's key maxims is: "Live as if you were already living for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as your about to act now!"
- Pg 111 - Meaning can be found in three different ways
    1. By creating a work or doing a deed
    2. By experiencing something or encountering someone
    3. By the attitude we take toward unavoidable suffering.
- Pg 111 - Love allows us to see the object of our love not only as who they are, but also the potential that they have. "Furthermore, by his love, the loving person enables the beloved person to actualize these potentialities."
- Pg 114 - "Our current mental-hygiene philosophy stresses the idea that people ought to be happy, the unhappiness is a symptom of maladjustment. Such a value system might be responsible for the fact that the burden of unavailable happiness is increased by unhappiness about being unhappy" - Edith Weisskopf-Joelson
- Pg 121 - "Having been is the surest kind of being."
- Pg 122 - "Pleasure is, and must remain, a side-effect or by-product, and is destroyed and spoiled to the degree to which it is made a goal in itself."
- Pg 131 - "Man is not fully conditioned and determined but rather determines himself whether he gives in to conditions or stands up to them. In other words, man is ultimately self-determining."
- Pg 132 - "Freedom... is not the last word. Freedom is only part of the story and half of the truth. Freedom is but the negative aspect of the whole phenomenon whose positive aspect is responsibleness. In fact, freedom is in danger of degenerating into mere arbitrariness unless it is lived in term sof responsibleness. What is why I recommended that the Statue of Liberty on the East Coast be supplemented by a Statue of Responsibility on the West Coast."
- Pg 133 - "A human being is not one thing among others; things determine each other, but man is ultimately self-determining."
- Pg 134 - "Man has both potentialities within himself; which one is actualized depends on decisions but not on conditions."

#### Postscript 1984

- Pg 141 - "Depression, aggression, addiction - are due to what is called in logotherapy 'the existential vacuum,' a feeling of emptiness and meaninglessness'"
- Pg 150 - Frankl reiterates his imperative: "Live as if you were living for the second time and had acted as wrongly the first time as you are about to act now."

#### Afterword - William J Winslade

- Pg 160 - It is a question of the attitude one takes toward life's challenges and opportunities, both large and small. A positive attitude enables a person to endure suffering and disappointment as well as enhance enjoyment and satisfaction. A negative attitude intensifies pain and deepens disappointments; it undermines and diminishes pleasure, happiness, and satisfaction; it may even lead to depression or physical illness.
