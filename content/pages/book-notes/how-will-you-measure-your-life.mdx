### How Will You Measure Your Life

Clayton M Christensen, James Allworth, and Karen Dillon

##### Prologue

- Pg 4 - “We are all vulnerable to the forces and decisions that have derailed too many”
- Pg 6 - “We… explore not what we hope will happen to us but rather what the theories predict will happen to us, as a result of different decisions and actions.”
- Pg 8 - “In the end [of this book], you can definitively answer for yourself the question ‘How will you measure your life?’”

##### 1 Just Because You Have Feathers…

- Pg 10 - “Theories… which help you make good choices, appropriate to the circumstances of your life.”
  - The concept of theories in the business world could be interchanged synonymously with principles in the gospel world.
- Pg 12 - “When people ask me something, I now rarely answer directly.”
  - Instead, answer a question with a theory and let the asker figure out how the theory applies to them.
- Pg 14 - “Good theory can help us categorize, explain, and, most importantly, predict.”
  - This is why the gospel is so applicable to every situation.
  - Data driven approaches cannot always help predict the future as well as a well-formed theory.
- Pg 15 - A hallmark of a good theory is that it dispenses its advice in “if-then” statements.
  - Choices and consequences
- Pg 16 - “So much of what’s become popular thinking isn’t grounded in anything more than a series of anecdotes.”
- Pg 17 - “You should learn all that you can from the past… but this doesn't solve the fundamental challenge of what information and what advice you should accept… using robust theory to predict what will happen has a much greater chance of success.

#### Part I - Finding Happiness in Your Career

- Pg 21 - “We pick our jobs for the wrong reasons and then we settle for them. We begin to accept that it’s not realistic to do something we truly love for a living.”
- Pg 22 - A strategy at a basic level is…
  - What a companies priorities are
  - How a company responds to opportunities and threats along the way
  - How a company allocates its resources
- Pg 23 - “The strategist in us needs to figure out what these better things are and then manage our resources in order to nourish them.”

##### 2 What Makes Us Tick

- Pg 30 - Parents sometimes default to thinking that external rewards are the most effective way to motivate the behavior they want from their children. That’s untrue.
- Pg 32 - Two factor theory states that hygiene factors (money, status, etc…) are not motivators, while other factors such as meaning, responsibility and growth are.
- Pg 36 - It’s important not to choose a career solely based on hygiene factors because an elevated lifestyle can lock us into a job that we cannot get out of.
- Pg 41 - What distinguishes factors as truly motivating?
  - Is it meaningful to me?
  - Will it give me a chance to develop?
  - Am I going to learn new things?
  - Will I have an opportunity for recognition and achievement?
  - Am I going to be given responsibility?

##### 3 The Balance of Calculation and Serendipity

- Pg 45 - Anticipated opportunities are things you can see and choose to pursue. These require deliberate strategies. Unanticipated opportunities are emergent strategies.
- Pg 46 - Be careful not to dismiss something as a distraction, when it could be the “next big thing” or have great potential.
- Pg 48 - Deliberate strategies = hygiene factors + motivators. Emergent strategies = experimenting and iterating quickly.
  - Your circumstances should determine which approach is best, although each will be making its best case to become our deliberate strategy.
  - “Your aspirations should be clear. You should know from your present experience that they are worth striving for.”
  - Don’t get too worried about unexpected opportunities, but focus on how to best achieve the goals you have deliberately set.
  - “You will begin to find the areas of work you love and in which you will shine.”
  - Put your strategy into ACTION! When you find what works, flip from emergent to deliberate!
- Pg 53 - “Discovery Driven Planning”
  - What has to prove true for this to work?
  - Before taking a job, think through the following:
    - What things are other going to need to do or deliver in order for you to successfully achieve what you hope to do?
    - What assumptions have to prove true in order for me to succeed?
    - What assumptions have to prove true in order for me to be happy in the choice I’m contemplating?
    - Am I basing my position on extrinsic or intrinsic motivators?
    - Why do you think this is going to be something you enjoy doing? What evidence do you have?
    - Be realistic about the path ahead.
- Pg 60 - “While you are still figuring out your career, you should keep the aperture of your life wide open. . . When you get it right, you’ll know.”

##### 4 Your Strategy is Not What You Say It Is

- Pg 62 - “Strategy… motivation… aspiration… means nothing if you do not align those with where you actually expend your time, money and energy... Real strategy is created through hundreds of everyday decisions about where we spend our resources.”
- Pg 71 - “To understand a company’s strategy, look at what they actually do rather than what they say they will do.” - Andy Grove, CEO of IBM
- Pg 71 - “We can tell our values by looking at our checkbook stubs” - Gloria Steinhem
- Pg 71 - We are trying to grow several businesses in our lives:
  - Rewarding relationship with spouse
  - Raising good kids
  - Successful careers
  - Contributing to our church or community
  - Etc…
- Pg 72 - If we are not careful, our strategy will be decided for us based on our “default criteria.” Usually this means that our resources will flow to wherever calls the loudest or wherever we achieve the most immediate reward.
- Pg 75 - “If the decisions you make about where you invest your blood, sweat and tears are not consistent with the person you aspire to be, you’ll never become that person.”
- Pg 75 - Goals -> Plans -> Action -> Time = Power

- Pg 81 - “Even when you know what your true priorities are, you’ll have to fight to uphold them in your own mind every day.”
- Pg 82 - “Work can bring you a sense of fulfillment - but it pales in comparison to the enduring happiness you can find in the intimate relationships that you cultivate with your family and close friends.”
- Pg 82 - “As a parent, you will try many things with your child that simply won’t work. When this happens, it can be very easy to view it as a failure. Don’t. If anything, it’s the opposite.”

##### 5 The Ticking Clock

- Pg 84 - “Paradoxically… the time when it is most important to invest in building strong families and close friendships is when it appears, at the surface, as if it’s not necessary.”
- Pg 87 - “93% of all companies that ultimately become successful had to abandon their original strategy - because the original plan proved not to be viable.”
- Pg 95 - “The most important time for the children to hear… words, the research suggests, is the first year of life.”
- Pg 95 - There is a difference between business language (“come here”, “drink your milk”, etc…) and language dancing (“how are you today?”, “do you want to wear your red shoes?”)
- Pg 97 - It is a fallacy to think that you can start focusing on a child’s academic performance when they hit school. You will miss an important window of opportunity.
- Pg 98 - “You’ll be routinely tempted to invest your resources elsewhere… your family and friends rarely shout the loudest to demand your attention.”

##### 6 What Job Did You Hire That Milkshake For?

- Pg 99 - “Companies focus too much on what they want to sell their customers, rather than what those customers really need. What’s missing is empathy”
- Pg 99 - “The same is true in our relationships: we go into them thinking about what we want rather than what is important to the other person.”
- Pg 110 - “ The two fundamental jobs that children need to do [at school] are to feel successful and to have friends - every day.”

- Pg 115 - Empathy + Action + Sacrifice = Deep Love
- Pg 116 - “Sacrifice deepens our commitment”
- Pg 117 - “I believe [sacrifice] is an essential foundation to deep friendships and fulfilling, happy families and marriages.”
- Pg 119 - “Thinking about your relationships from the perspective of the job to be done is the best way to understand what’s important to the people who mean the most to you. It allows you to develop true empathy.”

##### 9 The Invisible Hand Inside Your Family

- Pg 158 - "One of the most powerful tools to enable us to close the gap between the family we want and the family we get is culture."
