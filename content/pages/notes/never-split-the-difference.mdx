### Never Split the Difference

Chris Voss

#### Chapter 1 - The New Rules

- Pg 12 - "It is self-evident that people are neither fully rational nor completely selfish, and that their tastes are anything but stable" - Daniel Kahneman
- Pg 12 - Discoveries by Tversky and Kahneman highlight types of _cognitive bias_ that distort the way we see the world:
  - _Framing effect_ - People respond differently tot he same choice depending on how it's framed
  - _Prospect Theory_ - We take unwarranted risks in the face of certain losses
  - _Loss Aversion_ - People are more likely to avoid loss than to achieve an equal gain
- Pg 16 - Negotiation had to move from logical and rational to illogical and emotional
  - "People want to be understood and accepted. Listening is the cheapest, yet most effective concession we can make to get there."
  - "When individuals feel listened to, they tend to listen to themselves more carefully and openly evaluate and clarify their own thoughts and feelings"
  - "They tend to become less defensive and oppositional and more willing to listen to other points of view"
- Pg 16 - **Tactical Empathy** is the centerpiece of this new negotiating strategy and book.
- Pg 16 - "Contrary to popular opinion, listening is not a passive activity. It is the most active thing you can do."
- Pg 19 - Consecutive chapters build on each other. Master the earlier chapters to provide a foundation for later ones.

#### Chapter 2 - Be a Mirror

- Pg 24 - "Good negotiators, going in, know they have to be ready for possible surprises; great negotiators aim to use their skills to reveal the surprises they are certain exist."
- Pg 25 - "Use all new information that comes [your] way to test and winnow true hypotheses from false ones."
- Pg 26 - The less important your counterpart makes themselves, the more important they probably are (and vice versa)
- Pg 28 - We can process only about seven pieces of information in our conscious mind at any given moment - George A Miller
  - Instead of focusing on your counterargument or how to respond, focus your entire attention on listening and gleaning as much information about your counterpart as possible. Negotiation is a process of discovery.
- Pg 28 - "The goal is to identify what your counterparts _actually_ need (monetarily, emotionally, or otherwise)"
- Pg 30 - "The passage of time is one of the most important tools for a negotiator. When you slow the process down, you also calm it down."
- Pg 31 - Three voices to influence the conversation:
  - **Late-Night, FM DJ Voice**: Deep, soft, slow, and reassuring. Conveys that you're in control.
  - **Positive/Playful Voice**: Default voice. Easygoing, good-natured, light and encouraging. Smiling helps even if they can't see you. Lifts and relaxes the mood.
  - **Direct or assertive voice**: Used rarely. Will cause problems and create pushback.
- Pg 35 - "Mirroring, also called isopraxism, is essentially imitation... it can be done with speech patterns, body language, vocabulary, tempo, and tone of voice."
- Pg 36 - "We fear what's different and are drawn to what's similar"
- Pg 36 - "A 'mirror' is when you repeat the last three words (or the critical one to three words) of what someone has just said."
- Pg 43 - "Being right isn't the key to a successful negotiation - having the right mindset is."
- Pg 44 - Pattern for mirroring and building trust:
  - Use the late-night FM DJ voice
  - Start with "I'm sorry..."
  - Mirror
  - Silence. At least 4 seconds to let the mirror work its magic
  - Repeat

#### Chapter 3 - Don't Feel Their Pain, Label It

- Pg 50 - "[Good negotiators] are able to precisely label emotions, those of others and especially their own."
- Pg 51 - "There is nothing more frustrating or disruptive... than to get the feeling you are talking to someone who isn't listening."
- Pg 52 - "Empathy is paying attention to another human being, asking what they are feeling, and making a commitment to understanding their world."
- Pg 53 - "When we closely observe a person's face, gestures, and tone of voice, our brain begins to align with theirs in a process called neural resonance, and that lets us know more fully what they think and feel."
- Pg 53 - "Empathy is not about being nice or agreeing with the other side. It's about understanding them."
- Pg 54 - "Labeling is a way of validating someone's emotion by acknowledging it."
- Pg 55 - "Exposing negative thoughts to daylight... makes them seem less frightening."
  - "Labeling an emotion - applying rational words to a fear - disrupts its raw intensity."
- Pg 56 - Labels begin objectively with phrases like "It seems like...", "It sounds like..." or "It looks like..."
- Pg 57 - "A label's power is that it invites the other person to reveal himself."
- Pg 58 - "Labeling is a helpful tactic in de-escalating angry confrontations, because it makes the person acknowledge their feelings rather than continuing to act out."
- Pg 59 - "The best way to deal with negativity is to observe it, without reaction and without judgement."
- Pg 64 - The Accusation Audit - A way to acknowledge and diffuse the negative
  - List every terrible thing your counterpart _could_ saw about you.
  - Begin the conversation by bringing up some or all of these items
  - This disarms your counterpart and takes the sting out of their argument

#### Chapter 4 - Beware "Yes" - Master "No"

- Pg 75 - "Yes is often a meaningless answer that hides deeper objections"
- Pg 75 - "Yes and Maybe are often worthless. But No always alters the conversation."
- Pg 78 - "No" seems scary, but it's a "statement of perception far more often than of fact... [it's] often a decision, frequently temporary, to maintain the status quo. Change is scary"
- Pg 78 - "People need to feel in control. When you preserve a person's autonomy by clearly giving them permission to say 'No' to your ides, the emotions calm, the effectiveness of decisions go up, and the other party can really look at your proposal."
- Pg 79 - No usually means something like:
  - I am not yet ready to agreeingYou are making me feel uncomfortable
  - I do not understanding
  - I don't think I can afford
  - I want something else
  - I need more information
  - I want to talk it over with someone else
- Pg 80 - Three kinds of yes:
  - **A counterfeit yes** - One in which your counterpart plans on saying 'no', but feels 'yes' is an easier escape route or to disingenuously keep the conversation going.
  - **A confirmation yes** - An innocent, reflexive response to a black-or-white question. It's an affirmation with no promise of action.
  - **A commitment yes** - A true agreement that leads to action. It's buy-in or engagement.
- Pg 84 - "Connection is useless unless the other person feels that they are equally as responsible, if not solely responsible, for creating the connection and the new ideas they have."
- Pg 84 - "If we believe we can control or manage others' decisions with compromise and logic, we're leaving millions on the table."
- Pg 84 - "Everyone you meet is driven by two primal urges: the urge to feel safe and secure, and the need to feel in control."
- Pg 89 - No has a lot of skills in a negotiation:
  - "Allows the real issues to be brought forth"
  - "Protects people from making - and lets them correct - ineffective decisions"
  - "Slows things down so that people can freely embrace their decisions and agreements they enter into"
  - "Helps people feel safe, secure, emotionally comfortable, and in control of their decisions"
  - "Moves everyone's efforts forward"
- Pg 91 - Ways to get to "No"
  - "Mislabel one of the other party's emotions or desires"
  - "Ask the other party what they _don't_ want"
- Pg 93 - "We've instrumentalized niceness as a way of greasing the social wheels, yet it's often a ruse"
- Pg 94 - "Being pushed for 'yes' makes people defensive."

#### Chapter 5 - Trigger the Two Words that Immediately Transform Any Negotiation

- Pg 97 - The Behavioral Change Stairway Model (BCSM) - Active Listening, Empathy, Rapport, Influence, Behavioral Change
- Pg 97 - Real change can only come when a therapist accepts the client as he or she is - Carl Rogers
- Pg 98 - The sweetest two words in any negotiation are actually 'that's right'""
- Pg 105 - "'That's right' is great, but if 'you're right,' nothing changes"
- Pg 112 - "The more a person feels understood, and positively affirmed in that understanding, the more likely that urge for constructive behavior will take hold."
- Pg 112 - "Use a summary to trigger a 'that's right'. The building blocks of a good summary are a label combined with paraphrasing. Identify, rearticulate, and emotionally affirm [their world]."

#### Chapter 6 - Bend Their Reality

- Pg 115 - "Don't Compromise"
  - Example: "A woman wants her husband to wear black shoes with his suit. But her husband doesn't want to; he prefers brown shoes. So what do they do? The compromise, they meet halfway. And, you guessed it, he wears one black and one brown shoe. Is this the best outcome? No! In fact, that's the worst possible outcome. Either of the two other outcomes - black or brown - would be better than the compromise."
- Pg 116 - "We don't compromise because it's right; we compromise because it's easy and because it saves face... we compromise to be safe."
- Pg 116 - "Never split the difference. Creative solutions are almost always preceded by some degree of risk, annoyance, confusion, and conflict. Accommodation and compromise produce none of that."
- Pg 117 - "Deadlines are often arbitrary, almost always flexible, and hardly ever trigger the consequences we think - or are told - they will."
- Pg 117 - "No deal is better than a bad deal."
- Pg 118 - "'Give us the money or your aunt is going to die' is an early stage threat, as a time isn't specified. Increasing specificity on threats... indicates getting closer to real consequences."
- Pg 121 - "If you approach a negotiation thinking that the other guy thinks like you, you're wrong... That's not empathy; that's projection"
- Pg 122 - "While we may use logic to reason ourselves toward a decision, the actual decision making is governed by emotion."
- Pg 124 - Fairness is a tremendously powerful word that needs to be used with care:
  - It can be a defense move to destabilize the other side - "We just want what's fair"
    - If used on you, take a deep breath and ask questions to understand their concerns, mirror, and label
  - It can be used to accuse the other side as dense or dishonest - "We've given you a fair offer"
    - If used on you, label their accusation as a statement that they have evidence to support their claim of unfairness - "It seems like you're ready to provide the evidence that supports that."
  - It can be used to set the stage for honest and empathetic negotiation - "I want you to feel like you are being treated fairly at all times"
- Pg 127 - By understanding and applying principles of Prospect Theory we can bend our counterpart's reality
  - **Certainty Effect**: "People are drawn to sure things over probabilities, even when the probability is a better choice."
  - **Loss Aversion**: "People will take greater risks to avoid losses than to achieve gains"
- Pg 128 - "To get real leverage, you have to persuade them that they have something concrete to lose if the deal falls through"
- Pg 128 - Tactics to leverage prospect theory
  - Anchor their emotions - Start with an accusation audit the acknowledge their fears
  - Let the other guy go fist most of the time
  - Establish a range - Especially a "bolstering range" where the number you want is on the "conservative" end of the range.
  - Pivot to non-monetary terms
  - When you do talk numbers, use odd ones. Odd numbers seem more concrete
  - Surprise with a gift

#### Chapter 7 - Create the Illusion of Control

- Pg 141 - "Negotiation was coaxing, not overcoming; co-opting, not defeating... successful negotiation involves getting your counterpart to do the work for you and suggest your solution himself."
- Pg 150 - "Giving your counterpart the illusion of control by asking calibrated questions - by asking for help - is one of the most powerful tools for suspending unbelief."
- Pg 150 - "He who has learned to disagree without being disagreeable has discovered the most valuable secret of negotiation." - Robert Estabrook
- Pg 151 - "One of the greatest-of-all-time calibrated questions: 'How am I supposed to do that?'"
- Pg 152 - "Calibrated questions avoid verbs or words like 'can', 'is', 'are', 'do' or 'does.' These are close-ended questions that can be answered with a simple 'yes' or 'no'"
- Pg 152 - "It's best to start with 'what', 'how' and _sometimes_ 'why'". Examples:
  - What about this is important to you?
  - How can I help make this better for us?
  - How would you like me to proceed?
  - What is it that brought us into this situation?
  - How can we solve this problem?
  - What's the objective? / What are we trying to accomplish here?
  - How am I supposed to do that?
- Pg 158 - "The first and most basic rule of keeping your emotional cool is to bite your tongue"
- Pg 159 - "When you are verbally assaulted, do not counterattack. Instead, disarm your counterpart by asking a calibrated question."
- Pg 161 - "There is always a team on the other side. If you are not influencing those behind the table, you are vulnerable."

#### Chapter 8 - Guarantee Execution

- Pg 164 - "'Yes' is nothing without 'how'"
- Pg 167 - "The trick with 'how' questions is that, correctly used, they are gentle and graceful ways to say 'no' and guide your counterpart to develop a better solution."
- Pg 168 - "The other key benefit of asking 'how?' is that it forces your counterpart to consider and explain how a deal will be implemented."
- Pg 169 - "By making your counterparts articulate implementation in their own words, your carefully calibrated 'how' questions will convince them that the final solution is their idea."
- Pg 169 - "That's right" shows buy in. "You're right" or "I'll try" do not show any commitment.
- Pg 171 - "When implementation happens by committee, the support of that committee is key"
  - Ask calibrated questions to make sure that the hidden players have buy in.
- Pg 176 - The 7-38-55 rule - "7% of a message is based on the words while 38% comes from the tone of voice and 55% comes from the speaker's body language and face" - Albert Mehrabian
- Pg 177 - To get to commitment yes, follow the Rule of Three:
  - **The Rule of Three**: Get the other guy to agree to the same thing three times int he same conversation.
- Pg 178 - **The Pinocchio Effect**: "Liars use more words than truth tellers and use far more third-person pronouns... they tend to speak in more complex sentences in an attempt to win over their suspicious counterparts."
- Pg 179 - "The more in love they are with 'I,' 'me,' and 'my' the less important they are."

#### Chapter 9 - Bargain Hard

- Pg 193 - Three kinds of negotiators
  - **Analyst** - Methodical and diligent. Take the time needed to get it right. Rarely show emotion and may struggle to convey soothing tones. Often focus on research over interaction to get information. Skeptical by nature. Silence is an opportunity to think. The best thing they can do to overcome their weaknesses is to smile when they speak.
  - **Accommodator** - Relationship builder. As long as they're communicating, they're happy. They are most likely to build great rapport without accomplishing anything. Don't sacrifice your objections.
  - **Assertive** - Getting the solution perfect isn't as important as getting it done. Love winning above all else. Most of all, they want to be heard and usually won't listen until they do feel heard. Silence is an opportunity to speak more. Be particularly conscious of your tone.
- Pg 201 - Using assertiveness. Strategies to "punch back." Use them sparingly
  - Anger and passion can increase power of "asks," but can just as often backfire. Disagree or declare with poise.
  - Ask "why" questions
  - Use "I" statements
  - No neediness: Have a ready to walk mindset
- Pg 205 - Ackerman bargaining
  - Set your target price (your goal)
  - Set your first offer at 65% of your target price
  - Calculate three raises of decreasing increments (to 85, 95, and 100%)
  - Use lots of empathy and different ways of saying "No" to get the other side to counter before you increase your offer
  - When calculating the final amount, use precise, non-round numbers to give the number credibility and weight.
  - On your final number, throw in a non-monetary item (that they probably don't want) to show you're at your limit.

#### Chapter 10 - Find the Black Swan

- Pg 242 - "Except for a few naturals, everyone hates negotiation at first."
- Pg 242 - "Wimp-win deals are the norm in the kitchen and in the boardroom"
- Pg 243 - "Don't avoid honest, clear conflict."
- Pg 244 - "Let your known knowns guide you but not blind you." Search for the powerful unknown unknowns (the black swans)
- Pg 244 - "Black swans are leverage multiplies." Three kinds of leverage:
  - **Positive**: The ability to give someone what they want
  - **Negative**: The ability to hurt someone
  - **Normative**: Using your counterparts norms to bring them around
- Pg 244 - Black swans live inside your counterpart's worldview, religion or belief system.
- Pg 244 - "Review everything you hear from your counterpart. You will not hear everything the first time."
- Pg 245 - "Exploit the similarity principle. People are more apt to concede to someone they share a cultural similarity with."
- Pg 245 - "When someone seems irrational or crazy, they most likely aren't." Dig for their constraints, hidden desires or bad information.
- Pg 245 - Facetime is invaluable in revealing black swans

#### Appendix - Prepare a Negotiation One Sheet
- Pg 251 - "When the pressure is on, you don't rise to the occasion - you fall to your highest level of preparation."
- Pg 252 - The negotiation one sheet:
  - **Section I: The Goal**: Think about the best and worst outcomes from your negotiations. Accept that the worst is possible, but only write down a specific goal that represents the best case.
    - Set an optimistic but reasonable goal and define it clearly
    - Write it down
    - Discuss your goal with a colleague (this makes it harder to wimp out)

    - It seems like you don't like __________.
    - It seems like you value __________.
    - It seems like __________ makes it easier.
    - It seems like you're reluctant to __________.
  - **Section IV: Calibrated Questions**: Prepare 305 calibrated question to reveal value to you and your counterpart and identify and overcome potential deal killers. Be ready with follow-up labels
    - What are we trying to accomplish?
    - How is that worthwhile?
    - What's the core issue here?
    - How does this affect things?
    - How does this fit into what the objective is?
    - How does this affect the rest of your team?
    - How on board are the people not on this call?
    - What do your colleagues see as their main challenges in this area?
    - What are we up against here?
    - What's the biggest challenge you face?
    - How does making a deal with us affect things?
    - What happens if you do nothing?
    - What does doing nothing cost you?
  - **Section V: Non-cash Offers**: Prepare a list of non-cash items possessed by your counterpart that would be valuable.
