I'm Braden - currently finishing the Computer Science program at Brigham Young University. I've been in software development for three years and have loved every minute of it. This is where I host my blog and personal projects.

### Faith

I am an active member of [The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints]. I love my Savior [Jesus Christ] and strive each day to be a little more like Him. I know that I have a Father in Heaven that loves me unconditionally and wants me and my family to be happy now and eternally. One of the most powerful ways that I have been able to draw closer to Christ is through reading and following the principles taught in the [Holy Bible] and [The Book of Mormon].

### Family

I am happily married to my incredible wife [Michelle]. She is kind, loving and has an affinity for curly hair and film photography. Together, we are parents to a high-energy, brown-eyed little boy named [William] who loves lions with all his heart. We are not perfect parents, but we strive for [positive, purposeful parenting], a mostly [whole-foods, plant-based diet] and a [simple, organized home].

### Work

I'm currently a full-time student at [Brigham Young University] and a part-time software engineer at [Qualtrics]. In May 2020 my family and I will move to Seattle where I will be taking a job as a software engineer with [Microsoft].
