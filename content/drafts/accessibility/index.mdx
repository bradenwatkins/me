## 5 Easy Ways to Get Started With Accessibility

### 1 Make sure that your keyboard tabbing order is sane

If your website is easily tabbable, then it is likely pretty good for many disabled users.

- Tab order should usually run from top to bottom, right to left
- There should be a visual indicator of where tabbed focus is. Sometimes this is removed in the name of being more "aesthetically pleasing" [outlinenone.com]
- Skip links can be really helpful
- Use HTML links, buttons, and form elements correctly. Tab order will respect this
- tabindex=-1 makes it not tabbable
- tabindex=0 makes it tabbable
- tabindex>0 hoists it in the tabbing order (don't use it unless you're using)
